		\quad y(0)=1, y_{r}(0)=0 \end{equation*} where $m
		\in[0,5]$ is a constant parameter, is considered. The
		domain for the problem is $r \in[0, \xi],$ where $\xi$ is
		the first root of $y(r) .$ By making the change of
		coordinate $x \equiv r / \xi$ the original problem is
		recast as a nonlinear eigenvalue problem with three
		boundary conditions and $\xi$ as the eigenvalue:
		\begin{equation*} y_{x x}+\frac{2}{x} y_{x}+\xi^{2}
		y^{m}=0, \quad y(0)=1, y_{x}(0)=0, y(1)=0
		\end{equation*} A Chebyshev pseudospectral method is
		used to discretize $x,$ and it is found that a
		Newton-Kantorovich iteration always converges from
		an $m$ -independent initial state of
		\begin{equation*} y^{(0)}(x)=\cos \left(\frac{\pi}{2}
		x\right), \quad \xi^{(0)}=3 \end{equation*} The Lane-Emden
		equation has branch point singularities at the
		endpoint $x=1$ whenever $m$ is not an integer. It is
		shown that the Chebyshev coefficients decay as $1 /
		n^{2 m+5}$ as $n \rightarrow \infty ;$ however, a Chebyshev
		truncation of $N=100$ always yields at least ten
		decimal places of accuracy. The entire numerical
		algorithm in Maple is provided as a one-page table.},
